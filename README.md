# Mini Smartphone
## **KAIST EE** Hyein Woo, **POSTECH CSE** Seungyeon Seo
Mini Smartphone is an android application consisting of three tabs. The first tab is Contacts that are synchronized with the device's contacts. Contacts can be added, deleted, and modified, and search and phone functions are also supported. The second tab is the Gallery that is synchronized with the device's photo album. When you click each picture, you can use the zoom function. It is linked with Camera, so when you take a picture, it is immediately added to the Gallery. The last tab is the Calculator for Computer Science majors. The base converter provides binary, decimal, and hexadecimal and can be converted to each other. The bit operation calculator has a bitwise operation function. This calculator can be useful to computer scientists.

### Installation
You can run this project by connecting a virtual machine or physical device in Android Studio.

### Known Bugs
- If you use the camera continuously in the Gallery tab, the image list is not immediately updated. You have to switch to another tab and return to see your new photo.
- On first run, this application asks you for some privileges. After allowing the permission, you need to rerun the application.
- Also, if you take a picture with the camera launched from the Gallery tab, resolution is lower than the picture taken using the device's camera app.

This program is the first project of KAIST's madcamp. Since this is our first android application, it may not be perfect and efficient.
